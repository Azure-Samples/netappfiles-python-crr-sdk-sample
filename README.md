# Azure NetApp Files Cross-Region Replication (CRR) SDK NFS 4.1 Sample for Python

This project demonstrates how to deploy a cross-region replication enabled with NFS 4.1 protocol using python language and Azure NetApp Files SDK for python.  

In this sample application, we perform the following operations:

- Creation
  - Primary ANF Account
	| Primary Capacity pool 
		| Primary NFS v4.1 Volume 
		
  - Secondary ANF Account
	| Secondary Capacity pool
		| Secondary NFS v4.1 Data Replication Volume with reference to the primary volume Resource ID
			
 - Authorize source volume with destination volume Resource ID
 - Clean up created resources (not enabled by default) 

If you don't already have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212). 

## Prerequisites

1. Python (code was built and tested using version 3.9.5)
2. Azure Subscription
3. Subscription needs to have Azure NetApp Files resource provider registered. For more information, see [Register for NetApp Resource Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register).
4. Resource Group created.
5. Virtual Network with a delegated subnet to Microsoft.Netapp/volumes resource. For more information, see [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-network-topologies)
6. For this sample Python console application to work, we need to authenticate, and the chosen method for this sample is using service principals.
   1. Within an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) session, make sure you're logged on at the subscription where you want to be associated with the service principal by default:
        ```bash
        az account show
        ```
   
        If this is not the correct subscription, use:
   
        ```bash
        az account set -s <subscription name or id>  
        ```

    2. Create a service principal using Azure CLI.
   
        ```bash
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth
        ```
       >Note: this command will automatically assign RBAC contributor role to the service principal at subscription level, you can narrow down the scope to the specific resource group where your tests will create the resources.

    3. Copy the output content and paste it in a file called azureauth.json and secure it with file system permissions.
    4. Set an environment variable pointing to the file path you just created, here is an example with Powershell and bash:
            
        Powershell
   
        ```powershell
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION", "C:\sdksample\azureauth.json", "User")
        ```
        Bash

        ```bash
        export AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION=/sdksamples/azureauth.json
        ```
        >Note: for other Azure Active Directory authentication methods for Python, please refer to these [samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/tree/dev/sample). 

# What does example.py do? 

This sample project demonstrates how to enable cross-region replication in Azure NetApp Files for a NFS v4.1 enabled volume, similar to other examples. The authentication method is based on a service principal. This project will create two ANF Accounts in different regions with a capacity pool, a single volume using Standard service level tier in the Source ANF, and Data Replication Volume with Standard service level tier in the destination region. After the volumes are created, a replication is authorized between the two volumes. Finally, all created resources will be deleted via the cleanup process (as long as the appropriate variable in example.py has been set to 'True').

# How to run the script

1. Clone the script locally.
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/netappfiles-python-crr-sdk-sample.git
    ```
1. Change folder to **.\netappfiles-python-crr-sdk-sample\src**
2. Install any missing dependencies as needed
    ```bash
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```
    Alternatively, upgrade dependencies if they already exist
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade -r ./requirements.txt
    ```
3. Make sure you have the azureauth.json file and its environment variable with the path to it defined (as previously described at [prerequisites](#Prerequisites))
4. Edit file **example.py** and change the variables contents as appropriate (names are self-explanatory).
5. Run the script
    ```powershell
    python example.py
    ```
